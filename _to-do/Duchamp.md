I have forced to contradict myself in order to avoid conforming to my own taste

Borrow techniques from non artistic disciplines

Turn attention to least regarded phenomen

Deliberately leave something unfinished in artproject

Do art that doesnt care about how art has to be

making art is simply "to make"

Destroy art - do art for yourself

Invisible set of restrictions

Always share & support others

If you rely on your art for livelihood you lose independence of doing it

be sufficiently removed from business of making art

be content to earn small sums
