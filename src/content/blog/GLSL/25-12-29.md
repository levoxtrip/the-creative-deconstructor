This is an early start to the 2026 and my goal to start with shaders again and become good at it. Let's say where it leads me.
```glsl
void main(){
	vec3 color = vec3(0.0);


	color.r = sin(uv.x*u_time);	
	color.g = cos(uv.y*u_time);
	color.b = distance(uv,vec2(uv.y,uv.x));

	gl_FragColor = vec4(color,1.0);
}
```
