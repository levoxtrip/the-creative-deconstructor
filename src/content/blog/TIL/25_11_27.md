# 25-12-11 - Edge Blending
When you work with multiple projectors their projections overlay so you don't get any gaps between the projectors. To then create a smooth transition and don't have layered parts of the output you create *edge blending* on both overlapping edges. So you want to multiply your final image with a gradient texture that creates a smooth transition between white and black. What you want is where the projections overlap to create the original color value.
