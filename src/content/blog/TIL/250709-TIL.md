# 25-07-09 - Today I Learned...
If I want to access a local website like a local *p5.js* sketch on my ipad that is in the same network, i need to find the ip adress from my machine where the sketch is running and the port the sketch is running. Then I just can type in the adress into the browser of my tablet.

`ipadressmachine:port`
