# On creating art with computer

## Space
We perceive space as an empty area that we can fill with objects and matter. We are in and move in space.

We only can measure positions relative to something.

### Drawing on a 2D canvas
To draw in 2D space we need an origin(as reference point from which we can measure position relative to it), axis(along which me measure distances) and a unit(which defines how much distance corresponds to number 1)
