# About Lighting in 3D Scenes
For 3D scenes we can use different light types to create mood, composition and storytelling in our scene. Here are some types of lights:

*Point Light*
Increasing radius which softens the shadows and makes it more realistic
Best for light bulbs or candles
Anything small and localized

*Sun Light*
Works like a infinite light
It is lighting everything evenly bas on the lights rotation
To soften shadows increase the angle of light
Best for outdoor scenes, directional lighting light for sun or moonlight

*Spot Light* 
Emits light in a cone
adjust radius to soften shadows
Spot size changes with of cone
good for focus lighting, flash lights, car lights

*Area Light*
Emit light from rectangular or circular surface
Good for windows, screens or wide diffuse lighting

*Mesh Light*
Adding emissive material/shader to an object
Good for neon or glowing objects

*World Lighting*
Using HDMI to realistic reflection, natural lighting across scene and good for ambient illumination.

*Volumetric lighting*
To create fog, mist and godrays

## Placement and Power
The position, angle and brightness of the light define how objects are perceived.

*Light from above*
Mimics sunlight or overhead lamps

*side/backlighting* 
emphasises form and texture of object

*Lighting from below*
creates eerie or dramatic effects

*High intensity light*
makes your subject the focal point

*low intensity light* 
creates subtle or moody atmosphere

Lights behave differently depending on its distance to an object and its relative size to it.

Inverse square law
Doubling distance reduces intensity to one quarter

Further lights need to appear smaller and dimmer. And smaller relative size creates sharp shadows and dramatic lighting

Larger relative size gives fot diffused shadows for natural look

## Shape
The shape of light source affects reflections.
Round light allows a lot of creative control

## Color/Temperature
Contrast is balance between light and shadow

High contrast - dramatic differences, intense storytelling and focus

Low contrast - softens transitions, harmoney/calm scenes/natureal scenes

Use contrast to guide the viewers eye and create depth in composition

## Foundational lighting techniques
*three point lighting*
to illuminte subject clearly while lighting creates proper depth

*key light*
main light source placed at an angle to highlight subject*

*fill light*
soften secondary light to reduce high shadows*

*rim/hair/backlight*
behind subject to reate outline on glow
separating it from the background

*highkey lighting*
even bright lighting for cheerful moods

*lowkey lighting*
dim high contrrast lighting for dramatic storytelling

*split lighting* 
key light at 90°, leaving half the subject in shadow, for tention and impact


## Lighting Techniques
*unmotivated lighting*
Artistic lighting without visisble source in the scene
red/blue lights

*motivated lighting*
believable light source

*practical lighting*
visible lights within the scene like lamps or candels that ground shot in reality
