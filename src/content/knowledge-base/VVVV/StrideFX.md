# StrideFX

## Change mapping of transformed texture
If we want to change how a transformed texture gets scalled we can add `SamplerState` node to the *custom sampler* input of the `Transform(Filter)`.

## Group Textures
To group textures out of a for each loop in StrideFX in a similar way like a `Group(Spectral)` we need to use an accumulator and blend inside the for-each.
