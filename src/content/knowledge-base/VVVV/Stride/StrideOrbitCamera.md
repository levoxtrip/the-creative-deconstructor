# Orbit Camera in Stride
The basic interactions we can do in a `SceneWindow` with the `OrbitCamera` are:
-*Orbit(Rotate in Scene)* - drag with left mouse button
-*Track(Up and Down)*  - drag with middle mouse button
-*Dolly(Back and Forth)* - drag with right mouse button
-*Reset View* - Press and hold R
-*Show Edit mode* - F4

The camera needs to be part of the scene graph/added to `RootScene` node.
