# Skia
In VVVV *Skia* is the build-in 2D rendering library. *Skia* pack needs to be activated in the node browser on start.

We output our final composition with the `Renderer` node. It takes a layer input of all 2D content.

# 2D Primitives
Skia provides some basic *2D primitives* to draw
- `Rectangle`
- `RoundRectangle`
- `Circle`
- `Polygon` - allows to draw shapes from a multi point input - good to draw a data line with polygon
- `Spiral`
- `DrawImage`
- `Segment`



## Segment
`Segment` node is versatile node that for example allow to draw half circles and more.

## ConnectAll Points by Line
We can use `ConnectAll` node to get the *from* and *to* values from the line that connect two points. These we then can plug into a `Line` node to actually draw the line.

## Draw shape from spread of points
We can use `Polygon` Node to draw a shape of points from the spread.

## Draw a path from spread
If we want to draw a path from a spread we can path the spread values into a `AddPoly(Path)` node and then connect it with a `DrawPath` node. Check the *Close* input to set if the path should be closed or not.

## Move object along a path
The `SamplePath` node samples the path and allows us to move an object along a path. It also gives aus the *tangent* at the current position on the path which we can use to rotate the object along the path.

# Data types
- *Layer* - Layer to be rendered
- *SkiaPaint* - change the look
- *SKImage/SKPicture* - Image formats

# Paint/Style
The *SkiaPaint* property defines how a 2D primitive gets drawn

With `Stroke` we draw an outline and with `Fill` we can fill the primitive.

# Transform
With the `TransformSRT(Skia)` node we can apply *Rotation,Scale,Translation* transformation. It applies the transformations relative to the center of the object.
If we want to transform relative to an *anchor point* different from the center we can use `TransformSRT(Center)`.

## Rotate Shapes on circle
If we want to position shapes on a circular shape and then rotate each element towards the center we can use `CircleSpread` and then use the *position* and convert it into a rotation with an `Angle` node.

![Rotate Towards Center](/img/vvvv/RotateTowardsCenter.png)

## Chaining transformations

We also have each individual transformation as a node available 
`Translate`
`Rotate`
`Scale`
We can chain them and then input them into a `Transform` node.

![Separated transformations ](/img/vvvv/TransformSeperately.png)
A different order results in different transformations.



# Group
To join multiple layers we use the `Group` node to bring them together. First input is the layer most in the back.

With `CTRL +/-` we can create more or less inputs in to the node.

## Group spread of elements
After a Loop we get a spread of layers. With a `Group(Spectral)` node we can convert the spread into a single layer.


# Blend modes
We can set `SetBlendMode` node between the *primitive* and *Paint* nodes to define how layers get blended.

# Images
To draw images and svgs in Skia it uses the data types `SKImage` and `SkPicture`.

To get the image from a path we use a `ImageReader` and plug it into `DrawImage` node.

![Skia Draw Image](/img/vvvv/SkiaDrawImage.png)

To load *SVGS* we need the `SVGReader` and to draw the `DrawPicture`

Adding a `ColorFilter` with `Lighting` allows us to fill the svg with another color. 

`Lighting` multiplies RGB Channels by one color and then adds second color.

Skia allows us to also Render compositions off screen and allow us then to use the render as a data type `SKImage`. The render is then not shown in a window.

![OffScreenRenderSkia](/img/vvvv/OffScreenRenderSkia.png)

We then can also save the render into a file with `ImageWriter` node.
It allows us to set the path, file format quality and has a boolean to set to `write`

# Mixing Skia & Stride
To convert *Stride* into *Skia* we need to connect `RootScene` into a `SceneTexture` node and then connect the `SceneTexture` with `TextureToImage` and `FromImage(Imaging)`

![StrideToSkia](/img/vvvv/StrideToSkia.png)

# Videos
To draw videos in vvvv we need to reference the `VL.Video` package in the help browser.

We then can use the `VideoIn` or the `VideoPlayer`.Both return `IVideoSource` data type that needs to be converted with `VideoSourceToSKImage`


![Skia draw videocam](/img/vvvv/DrawVideoCamInput.png)
To draw your camera input we need to connect `VideoIn` node into a `VideoSourceToSKImage` and then connect it with the `DrawImage` node.

With `CameraControls` we can set values like *Pan*,*Exposure*,*Zoom* etc.

To show a video we can use `VideoPlayer` node, ether to show video from a `url` or to show a video from our computer.

# Draw a drop shadow
To draw a drop shadow we can add `Image Filter` with `DropShadow` node to the primitive.

# Create Shiny effect
For shiny effects we add a `SetShader` and a `Radial Gradient`node. To make the it only apply the bright colors we can set a `SetBlendMode`

![SetShinyShadder](/img/vvvv/SetShinyShadder.png)

# Camera
In Skia we also have a `Camera` node which allows us to navigate through the Skia Window but it also allows us to set a fixed view position with its parameters.

# Show Performance meter
With `F2` we can show the performance of our sketch
