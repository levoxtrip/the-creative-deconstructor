# Organize sketch with background frame
To create a better overview of the sketch we can create *background frames* that include certain logic of the project.
Select nodes and hit `ALT + F`.
You then can give the area a name and color and even create screenshots of it. These background frames also allow us to move the whole part inside the sketch window.
