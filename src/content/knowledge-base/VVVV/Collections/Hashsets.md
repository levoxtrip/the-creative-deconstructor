# Hashsets
Hashsets works similar to the keys in dictionaries. For more information about dictionaries look [here](/files/vvvv/Dictionary.md).
The use case for `HashSet` is when you have a collection where you can have an item exactly once. For example an iventory. You only have one item in it and you just want one amount and you don't want to create a new entry.
