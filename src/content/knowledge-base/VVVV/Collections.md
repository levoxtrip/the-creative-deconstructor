## Spreads
Look [here](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/introduction/lo_9_2_Spreads) for deeper information 
### Make own spread manually
To create a spread from only one value we can use the `FromValue(Spread)` node.
![Spread From Value](/img/vvvv/SpreadFromValue.png)

With the `Repeat(Spread)` node we can create a spread with multiple times the same value.

With `Cons` node we can collect multiple values in a spread. With *CTRL +/-* we can add and delete inputs.

We also can create a spread via the IOBox menu. You first select `Spread` and then the data type of the elements of the spread.

### Make iteration spread
With `I` as *Integer* we can create a spread of integers in a given range.
*Start* defines first value and *Count* how many elements in the spread you want to have.

You need to activate the *advanced* nodes to see the `I` node.
### Queue Slices into a Spread
`Queue` allows us to add slices into spread when a *trigger input* is true.

![Trigger Input Into Spread](/img/vvvv/TriggerInputIntoSpread.png)

*Frame Count* imput defines how many values the `Queue` can contain.
If *Frame Count* input is *-1* the `Queue` can contain endless values. 

### Automatic Spread generators
VL contains nodes that automatically generate spreads with values that are in a specific relation to each other.
#### One dimensional spreads

`LinearSpread` creates linear values within a range specified by the *width* and *center* input.

`RandomSpread` generates random values within a range, specified by *width* and *center*.

#### Two dimensional spreads

`RectangleSpread` - Generate rectangle position values.
![alt text](/img/vvvv/RectangleSpread.png)

`CircleSpread` - Generate circle position values.
![CircleSpread](/img/vvvv/CircleSpread.png)
`GridSpread` - Generate 2D grid position values.
![GridSpread](/img/vvvv/GridSpread.png)
`SpiralSpread` - Generate spiral position values.
![SpiralSpread](/img/vvvv/SpiralSpread.png)

`RandomSpread(2D)` - Generate random position values.

##### Random morph between spread values
With a `Randomizer` node after a switch and then *dampining* the values in the `ForEach` we can create a *morphing* behaviour between the spread values.

![Random Morph Between Spread Values](/img/vvvv/RandomMorphBetweenSpreadValues.png)


#### Three dimensional spreads

`RandomSpread(3D)` - Generate random position values in 3D space

`GridSpread(3D)` - Generate 3D grid position values.

To use 2D spreads in 3D space we need to add `ForEach` slice in the spread another dimension in the vector. So from *2D* we need to go into a *3D* vector. We can use a 3D `Vector(Join)` node and plug the values from the *2D* in there.

### Pick element of spread
To pick an element out of a spread we can use `GetSlice` and then set the *index* of the data point we want.

### Get spread out of spread
To grab multiple consecutive elements from a spread we can use `GetSpread`.


### Get multiple slices of spread
To extract multiple elements from a *Spread* we can use `Decons` node and expand the amount of values with *+/-*.

### Get first/last slice of spread
With `SplitFirst` and `SplitLast` we can get the first or last slice in the spread.


### Change values in Spread
To add a value at the end of the spread we can use `Add(Spread)` node.

To *add* a value at a specific position we use `InsertSlice(Spread)`.

To *change* a value at a specific position use the `SetSlice(Spread)`.

We can *remove* a slice at a specific position with `RemoveSliceAt(Spread)`.

With `Clear(Spread)` we can remove all slices.

### Split Spread into two spreads
With the `SplitAt(Spread)`node we can create two spreads out of one. *Index* defines where they get split. 


### Analyze spreads

To *count* the amount of slices in a spread we can use the `Count(Spread)` node.

To *check if spread contains specific value* we can use `Contains(Spread)` node. This returns a boolean value.

For the *average* value of a spread we can use `Average` node.

### Change order of spreads

To change the order of a spread into a *random order* we can use the `Randomizer` node.

To *reverse the order* of the spread we use the `Reverse(Spread)`

### Convert any sequence into spread
Because any collection in VL is a sequence we can convert any collection into a spread with `FromSequence(Spread)`

### Combining Spreads with Pads
Storing our spreads in to `Pads` allow us to manipulate it's data over the runtime of our program.

### Deconstruct Spread into it's values

### Resample Spread Values
We can resample a spread and make the transition between the values of the initial collection smoother. We can apply this if we for example want to create smoother path between points.[How to draw path from spread](/files/vvvv/Skia.md#draw-a-path-from-spread)

With `ResampleBSpline` we can define how many Resample steps we want.


## Dictionaries

In Dictionaries the *values are saved by a key*.
The *key* is most of a time a *string* and can only exist one time in the dictionary.

Similar to spreads we ether can define the *adaptively* by setting the data type in the `Add(Dictionary)` node or we strictly define the data type in the `Pad` that stores the `Dictionary` data.

![Create Dictionary](/img/vvvv/CreateDictionaryValue.png)

With `Clear(Dictionary)` we can delete all entries from the Dictionary.

To manipulate an already existing key-value pair we can use `SetItem(Dictionary)` node.

With `Remove(Dictionary)` we can delete a specific element by the *key*.

We also have `Keys(Dictionary)` and `Values(Dictionary)` nodes to only get the *keys* or *values* from a dictionary.

To check if a `Dictionary` contains *keys* or *values* we can use
`ContainsKey`, `ContainsValue` or `Contains(Dictionary)`.

To get a value by it's get we can use the `TryGetValue(Dictionary)` node.

With `Count(Dictionary)` we can calculate the amount of entries in the `Dictionary`


## Sequence

## Iterations
[VL Explanation here](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/language/loops)
### For each
To iterate through all items in the spread, we need to use the *splicer* input into a `ForEach` region. It's icon looks like a filter. 
![Splicer For Each](/img/vvvv/SplicerForEach.png)

In the `ForEach` region we then can apply operations to each element individually.

If you pass in two spreads with different length in to the `ForEach` region it will only execute the amount of entries of the smaller spread.

![Smaller Spread Defines Amount Of Iteration](/img/vvvv/SmallerSpreadDefinesAmount.png)

For also can create nested loops with multiple `ForEach` loops inside of each other.

To convert these *nested spreads* into a normal *spread* we have to use `Flatten` node.

![NestedLoops](/img/vvvv/NestedLoops.png)


### Repeat
The `Repeat` region repeats everything that is inside of the region for a specified amount of times.

#### Using Repeat with Process Node
We can use a `Repeat` with our own Process Node inside. If we want to create random start data for the content nn that Process Node we can take advantage of `Create` and `Update` operations to setup each Instance with different data.


### Looping

`ForEach` and `Repeat` regions give us `Index` pin which allows us to use the *Index* of the current iteration to change values.

![Is index even](/img/vvvv/IsIndexEven.png)

The `Keep` pin allows to only keep the elements that match a conditions with true value. So we can decide which elements should be included and which not. 

![Only Keep Value Where Y Bigger Than.png](/img/vvvv/OnlyKeepValueWhereYBiggerThan.png)

#### Accumulator
The *accumulator* allows you to to pass on the result from the first iteration to the next iteration and so on.
![Accumulator](/img/vvvv/Accumulator.png)
The link from the diamond shape is the value from the previous iteration and the link from splicer is the value in the current iteration.

We also can use an *initial* value for the first iteration. For that we need to plug a value from the outside into the accumulator icon.

#### Define what elements are kept in For-Each
We can use the `Keep` node *inside* the *for-each* to define which information we want to output from a spread.
