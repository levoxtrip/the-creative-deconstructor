![Cast Object Type](/img/vvvv/CastObjectType.png)

# Object
`Object` is the base data type of every type in *C#*. It is the parent and everything else inherits from it. Most of the time avoid using the data type because it is to general. Just sometime at runtume we want to say *This could be anything* and at compile time we can define specifically with `CastAs` what type it should be.
