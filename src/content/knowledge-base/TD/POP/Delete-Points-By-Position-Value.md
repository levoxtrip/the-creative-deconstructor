# Delete Points By Position Value
![Delete Points Shape With FieldPOP Shape Img](/img/TD/DeletePointsByPositionValue.png)
We can use the the value of the points position to determine which part of our shape we want to delete. We set `P(1)` as the attribute in the `DeletePOP` and define a `Function` which determines which points to keep and which one to delete.

We also can use the Z Position of the points `P(2)` to only select a certain slice of a 3D Grid.
