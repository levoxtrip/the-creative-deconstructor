# Converting DAT into CHOP Graph

Often we want to convert table data into a graph which makes the data more accessible or to convert it to visuals. 

Basic idea is we convert the `null1` with `datto` into a CHOP.
In the `dattoCHOP` we select if the first row of the data is already a value or the name of the data channel. 
As the output we set `Single Channel`.
