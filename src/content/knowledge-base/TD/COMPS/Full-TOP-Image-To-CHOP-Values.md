![Floating Window with WindowCOMP](/img/TD/FloatingWindowComp.png)
# Full TOP image to CHOP values
If you want a floating window of for example specific operators you can use a `windowCOMP`. Assign a *window operator* that you want to show in the floating window and then 
click on open as seperate window.

You also can create a little script that creates a new `windowCOMP` on Button Click and opens it. I attached this example as a download.
