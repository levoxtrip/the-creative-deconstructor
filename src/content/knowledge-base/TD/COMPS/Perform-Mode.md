# Perform mode
We use *perform mode* if we want to exhibit our work or don't need to work inside the network area anymore. The perform mode frees up resources that would be saved for the network area. 


To start your project automatically in perform mode 
*Dialogs->WindowPlacement-> Check Start in perform mode*


## Perform window
To have perform window *always fullscreen* set `Size` `Fill Location`

To get rid of the bar of your operating system on the perform window `Disable Borders`
