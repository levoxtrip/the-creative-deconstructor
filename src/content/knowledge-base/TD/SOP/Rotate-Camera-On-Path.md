# Rotate Camera On Path
If we want that the camera rotates around the geometry and always looks at it we can assign a `PathSOP` to the `Pathsop` parameter of the camera and also let the camera `LookAt` a `NullComp`. Set the `translatex` of the camera to 0 and scale down the geometry so it fits the view of the camera.
