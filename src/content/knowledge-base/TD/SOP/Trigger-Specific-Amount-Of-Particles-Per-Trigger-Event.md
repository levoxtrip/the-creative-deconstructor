# Trigger Specific Amount Of Particles Per Trigger Event
The `ParticleSOP` emits a certain amount of particles per second. If you want to emit a specific amount of particles every time a trigger event happens you can take `root.time.rate` and use it to multiply the `TriggerCHOP` signal in a `MathCHOP`. The amount of particles that should get emitted we can set in `Peak Level` parameter of the `TriggerCHOP`
