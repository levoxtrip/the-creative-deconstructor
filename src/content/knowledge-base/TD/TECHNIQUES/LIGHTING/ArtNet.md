# Art-Net

Art-Net is a protocol that transmits DMX512 lighting data over ethernet networks.

Instead of using DMX cables, it sends data as UDP packets over ethernet infrastructure with switchers, routers

A single art-net network can carry up to 32,768 universes of dmx data.

Art-Net can achieve refresh rates of 100+ hz depending on network conditions.

Art-Net allows two way communication, to send status information back to the controllers.
