# Network Communication

With `TouchOut` we can communicate between networks and machines - We can send TOP,CHOP,DAT data.
This allows us to send data from one TouchDesigner patch to another TouchDesigner patch.

Always think also about latency which happens when communicating between two machines.

If we want to send SOP data we can convert it into DAT data and then convert it back in the second patch.
