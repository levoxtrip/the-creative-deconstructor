# Common Tab in COMPs
The *Common* tab of COMPs have some useful parameters that make the reference easier and give you some extended functionality.

## Parent Shortcut
The *Parent Shortcut* allows you to define a name which will become a reference *inside* the operator. You can create for example `MyComp` as a shortcut for the operator. This allows you tto reference the comp with `parent.myComp` and you get the whole operator reference where you can access all the parameters and fucntions. So from anywhere inside the comp you can get to the top level component with the reference.

## Global Shortcut
