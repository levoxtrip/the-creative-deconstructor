# Convert RampTOP into Lines
Normally, the `RampTOP` shows smooth color transitions between different colors.
If you want to change your `RampTOP` from linear interpolated values between the colors into lines we can use `step` for the `Interpolate Notches` value. This creates lines instead of gradients between the values.
