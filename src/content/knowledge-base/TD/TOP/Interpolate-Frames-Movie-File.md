# Interpolate Frames Movie File

In TouchDesigner we can interpolate between the frames of a video. This is often useful when we play a video file really slow. 
To allow the interpolation, in the parameter window of the `MovieFileInTOP` we can go to the *Image* tab and set `Interpolate Frames` to *On*.
