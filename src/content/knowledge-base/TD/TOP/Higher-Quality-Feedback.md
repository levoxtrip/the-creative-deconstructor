# Higher Quality Feedback

If you want to raise the quality of your feedback effects it can make sense to set the pixel format to 16bit instead of 8bit default settings. As you can see in the images and in the file below the difference is quite strong.
The disadvantage is that it needs more performance from the system. So as usual the balance between performance and visual output is important.
