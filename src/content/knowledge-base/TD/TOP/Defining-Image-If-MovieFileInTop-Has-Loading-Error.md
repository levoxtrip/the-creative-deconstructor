# Defining Image if MovieFileInTop has Loading Error

Normally TouchDesigner shows a black image with a red rectangle on the bottom to show that the `moviefileinTOP` has a loading error. 
But we can change that image to transparent by navigation to `Image` in the parameter window and setting `Loading/Error Image` to `Zero`.
