# Low Pixel Noise To Blend In/Out
We can use a `NoiseTOP` to control the blending of different visuals on for example multiple screens. Or just to blend visuals in and out on each screen.
Combine with a `LayoutTOP` each visuals horizontally and then `MultiplyTOP` to combine the `NoiseTOP` with the `LayoutTOP`.
