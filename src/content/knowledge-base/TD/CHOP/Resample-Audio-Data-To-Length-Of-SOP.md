# Resample Audio Data to Length of SOP

When you want to map CHOP Data like an Audiofile to the length of your SOP you can use a `resampleCHOP`. As the source you plug in the origianl Audiofile data. As the second input you use a `sopto` from the SOP you want to use for the amount of samples/points.
